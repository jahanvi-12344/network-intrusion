Network Intrusion Detection Project (Classification - Supervised Learning)
Objective:
Predict whether a network connection is normal or anomalous to enhance cybersecurity measures.

Steps:

Data Collection:
Gather network traffic data from sources like kaggel intrusion datasets.

Data Preprocessing:

Clean Data: Remove irrelevant features.
Handle Missing Values: Use imputation techniques (mean, median) for missing data.

Normalize Data: Scale features using techniques like Min-Max scaling to ensure consistent value ranges.

Model Training:
Choose classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression,Random Forest.
Split data into training and test sets (e.g., 80-20 split).

Prediction and Evaluation:
Predict whether a connection is normal or anomalous.
Evaluate performance using metrics like Accuracy, confusion matrix.
